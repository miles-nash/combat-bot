# Combat Bot 2018
I decided to build this robot for the sparkfun avc event next weekend. It may not ein any awards but I have always wanted a fighting robot.
The robot will feature a spinning vertivle ramp with ramp leading up to it. Electronics will be controlled by an arduino.
It will be participating in the plastic ants k-12 division next saturday.
